# 🧪 Advanced iOi Examples: The "No-Exception" Proof

The core strength of the **iOi Protocol** is its lack of ambiguity. While most rules are for rhythm and "Auto-Correct" prevention, **Rule #2 (The i/L Lock)** is a technical constant.

## 🧱 The Hierarchy of Rules
1. **Rule #2 (i/L Lock)**: ABSOLUTE. Overrides everything.
2. **Rule #1 (Inverse Initiation)**: General. Overridden by Rule #2.
3. **Rule #3 & #4 (Deconfliction & Rhythm)**: Dynamic.

## 🔍 Edge Case Analysis

### 1. The "Letter" Case
* **Standard:** Letter
* **iOi Output:** `LeTtEr`
* **Why?** Even though Rule #1 says start with lowercase, Rule #2 mandates that 'L' is **ALWAYS** uppercase. **Security over Style.**

### 2. The "Illness" Case
* **Standard:** Illness
* **iOi Output:** `iLLnEsS`
* **Why?**
    * Starts with `i` (Lowercase - Rule #2).
    * Double `LL` remains uppercase (Rule #2 overrides Rule #3's case-switching).
    * This creates a unique visual "wall" (`iLL`) that is impossible to misread.

### 3. All-L/i Words
* **Standard:** Lili
* **iOi Output:** `LiLi`
* **Result:** Perfect clarity. No confusion with "1111" or "IIII".
