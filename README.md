​📜 tHe mIsSiOn
​In official databases (Customs, Banking, Traffic), names suffer from Homoglyph Ambiguities (L vs I) and Auto-Correct Corruption.
This protocol transforms a name from a "Text String" into a "Visual Pattern" that demands attention.
​As stated in the dReAmErS tRaiNiNg philosophy:
​"dEtAiLs aRe mAgiC oNLy iF yOu kNoW wHaT aRe yOu LoOkiNg fOr"
​⚙️ tHe aLgOrItHm (cOrE rUlEs)
​1. iNvErSe iNiTiAtIoN
​Rule: The string MUST start with a lowercase letter.
​Why: Breaks the "Auto-Correct" habit and flags the text as case-sensitive code.
​2. tHe hOmOgLyPh lOcK (L/i Rule)
​Rule A: Letter 'i' must ALWAYS be lowercase (i).
​Rule B: Letter 'L' must ALWAYS be UPPERCASE (L).
​Result: Ismail becomes iSmAiL. Zero ambiguity.
​3. dOuBlE-lEtTeR dEcOnFLiCtIoN
​Rule: Consecutive identical letters must switch case to force a conscious keystroke.
​Example: ss becomes sS.
​4. aLtErNaTiNg fReQuEnCy
​Rule: Characters alternate case (Small/Capital) to create a visual rhythm that prevents the eye from skimming.
